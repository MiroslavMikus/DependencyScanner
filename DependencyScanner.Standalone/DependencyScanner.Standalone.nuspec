    <summary>Simple tool to help you mantain dependencies of any dot net project.</summary>
    <description>
      **Dependency scanner is free solution management software for dot net projects.**

      ## Main features

      -  Browse your solutions
      - Consolidate NuGet packages versions within one solution.
      - Consolidate NuGet packages solution independent. This is a great help if multiple solutions have to have the same NuGet versions.
      - Nuspec updater. You can update all dependencies of your nuspec files with one click.

      ## Other great features

      - Build in simple git client:
      - The client can update all remote (git update remote) references while searching for your solutions so you can always compare the latest source code.
      - You can see the current (git) status of all your solutions.
      - You can quickly switch between all your local branches *so far the state allows*.

      - Dependency scanner can now recognize if there is no internet connection and therefore cut all remote calls

      **Improvements**:

      - Huge refactoring under the hood
      - Getting git informations is now faster

      **Bug-Fix**:
      - [7#](https://github.com/MiroslavMikus/DependencyScanner/issues/7) Choco-updater internet problems
